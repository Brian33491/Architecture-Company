                     favorite no way yeah I haven't seen it yep that guy Zach is his name and he loves it yeah he really loves it no way so I I'd 
                     wandered there um and uh this time got a better sense of it but it's a great City huh yeah it's a good place it's like a little
                      city it's like a little City kind of like a fancy little city it's almost like the Jean banet of cities kind of
                     like d you know look at this outfit kind of you know but dangerous at the same but has like kind of like an element of like 
                     mystery kind of that's a kind of a weird example no but you're not are you from there no I'm from Louisiana but but Nashville
                      here's what it is it's safe it's nice people are friendly um you can't cheat on your wife there so it's not cuz the city's too
                       small too small okay you couldn't take your wife or spouse or significant other um you couldn't even yeah like 
                       and you couldn't take them to dinner or something and not see somebody that would know one of you or them</p>
